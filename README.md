## Introduction

Market segmentation analysis involves identifying meaningful patterns and clusters within a dataset containing information about customers or market entities. This project employs various data analysis techniques to uncover insights and facilitate decision-making in marketing strategies.

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
- **Pre-processing Data:** Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving important information.
- **K-means Clustering:** Segment the customer base into distinct groups based on characteristics and behaviors.
- **Insights and Visualization:** Interpret clusters and visualize key features contributing to customer segmentation.
